My name is Sherwin, and my goal today is to leave you with a few tips, tricks, and anecdotes that will hopefully help you get to where you want to go.

Getting out of ![vim width:56px](./assets/vim.png) is not that hard.

**Here are the essentials.**

- `:` + `wq` - To write and quit
- `:` + `qa!` - To quit and discard
- `:` + `line number` - To go to line
- `i` - To start typing
- `u` - To undo last change
- `ESC` - To get out of the last mode

---

**Beyond that you might not need to know the rest.**

- `dd` - To delete the line
- `O` - To start typing before the line
- `o` - To start typing after the line
- `g` + `g` + `d` + `G` - Select all and delete

---

<!-- This is a teachable moment -->

### Take a moment to try to understand the problem.

For example, Vi predates the usage of arrow keys and mice on computers.

**Why is Vim still relevant anyways?**

- It is the default text editor for many CLI tools
- It works well via SSH
- It is great for power users

#### Don't forget to pack the essentials.

Gather everything you have learned along the way and keep it in a central place.

Every time you find yourself strugglling to grasp something, take notes. Leave yourself breadcrumbs explaining how you solved something.

### Future you will be grateful.

## Learn

### Git.

---

![bg left contain](./assets/gitgraph.png)

Similar to Vim you don't need to _master_ the thing, just don't let it _push_ you around.
\---

```sh
git reflog
```

^ Anybody know what this does?

---

Did you know about the `-p` flag when you use `mkdir`?

```sh
mkdir -p ~/code/cool-project/public/assets/
```

---

Where you go from here is entirely up to you, but be sure to pick up a few souveniers on the way...

---

<!-- Talk a little bit about my journey, and the things I gathered on the way  -->

#### Be ready to learn.

Don't limit yourself to a specific technology.

![bg right cover](./assets/quilt.jpg)

#### Get people to review your code.

and

#### Spend some time looking at code.

Excerpt from [logzio-nodejs](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-nodejs/blob/master/lib/logzio-nodejs.js) library

```js
const jsonToString = (json) => {
  try {
    return JSON.stringify(json);
  } catch (ex) {
    return stringifySafe(json, null, null, () => {});
  }
};

const messagesToBody = (messages) => messages.map(jsonToString).join(`\n`);

const UNAVAILABLE_CODES = [
  "ETIMEDOUT",
  "ECONNRESET",
  "ESOCKETTIMEDOUT",
  "ECONNABORTED",
];

const zlibPromised = (body) =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    zlib.gzip(body, (err, res) => {
      if (err) return reject(err);
      return resolve(res);
    });
  });
```
